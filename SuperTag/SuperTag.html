        <h2>My Work on the Project</h2>
        <article>
            <p>Super Tag was my very first team-based video game project. It was also my first time using Unreal Engine 4, as well as my first steps into several key technical areas: networking, source control, and more generally, collaborative development on a fully-featured engine. In short, everything was new to me !</p>
            <h3>Getting Started as a Gameplay Programmer</h3>
            <p>My very first task was to implement a grappling hook system fully functional in networked multiplayer. I took more time than expected to complete it, but in hindsight, that time was essential. It allowed me to truly understand how the engine works, to get comfortable with multiplayer logic, and—most importantly—to lay a solid foundation for the rest of the project.</p>
            <h3>Exploring New Gameplay Mechanics</h3>
            <p>Once the grappling system was up and running, I started working on more complex gameplay mechanics. Among them were interactive poles designed to give players new movement options:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>When a pole was vertical, the player could grab onto it to perform a sharp 90-degree turn.</li>
                <li>When horizontal, it served as a pivot point to reach distant platforms without using the grappling hook.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Although these features were successfully implemented, their integration into the game flow wasn’t ideal—they ended up slowing the player down rather than enhancing movement. This led me to rethink their value from a gameplay perspective.</p>
            <h3>Additional Contributions</h3>
            <p>Later on, I worked on laser traps that added a new layer of tension and gave players a way to troll or outsmart their opponents, while also enriching the level design. I also had the chance to explore UI development—a field I had never touched before—which helped me broaden my skill set even further..</p>
        </article>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>Working on Super Tag was a truly formative experience. It pushed me out of my comfort zone, taught me the fundamentals of multiplayer gameplay, team collaboration for a video game, and Unreal Engine 4, and gave me the confidence to tackle complex systems from scratch. This project marked the beginning of my journey as a gameplay programmer—and laid the groundwork for everything I’ve built since.</p>
