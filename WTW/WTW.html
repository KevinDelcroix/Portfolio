   My Work
   =================== */-->

    <section id="my-work">
        <h2><strong>My Work on the Project</strong></h2>
        <h3><strong>Integration</strong></h3>
        <p><strong>Although it seemed intimidating at first, working in a team speaking a different native language posed no problem. English naturally became our common language, and my colleagues were always willing to rephrase things when necessary.</strong></p>
        <img src="Images/team.png" alt="Cyborn Team">
        <p><strong>The family spirit at Cyborn greatly facilitated my integration. During lunch breaks, video game sessions were often organized, strengthening bonds between colleagues. Another significant example was the company's 25th-anniversary celebration, where each employee was invited to bring a guest.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Moreover, as an intern, I had the honor of representing Cyborn at the Stereopsia convention in Brussels. There, I presented the studio and its first game to VR professionals.</strong></p>
        <img src="Images/convention.png" alt="Brussels convention">

        <h3><strong>Fast Prototyping</strong></h3>
        <p><strong>Upon arrival, after reviewing the technical documentation, I was tasked with fast prototyping. This phase likely aimed to assess my skills while exploring potential features.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>It was extremely educational. Notably, I worked on an elastic system: the player needed to be able to stretch it, aim, and propel themselves.
This challenge pushed me out of my comfort zone (managing stretching limits, visual feedback, gameplay coherence), but I emerged more confident.</strong></p>
        <div class="media-hover">
            <img src="Images/rubberband.png" alt="rubberband">
                <video class="hover-video" muted loop preload="none">
                    <source src="Images/Rubberband.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                </video>
        </div>
        <p><strong>Another significant prototype involved a constellation puzzle: the player had to align a constellation displayed on their wrist with a group of stars in the environment. The challenge was to accurately detect alignment while ensuring each constellation was unique and recognizable from a specific angle.</strong></p>
        <div class="media-hover">
            <img src="Images/stars.png" alt="stars">
                <video class="hover-video" muted loop preload="none">
                    <source src="Images/Stars.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                </video>
        </div>
        <p><strong>This phase allowed me to understand their development logic (naming conventions, tools, best practices…) and boosted my self-confidence.</strong></p>

        <h3><strong>Starting Work on WTW with Primitive Providers</strong></h3>
        <p><strong>After about a month of prototyping, I joined the main team to develop the game's core features. I was thrilled to contribute more concretely.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Soon, I was entrusted with a challenge: each building in the city was merely a visualization without a real entity in the engine. It was therefore impossible to interact with these elements (change their texture, color...).</strong></p>
        <p><strong>I proposed a solution: the Primitives Providers. This system acts as a visual identity card for each building, separate from its business logic.
Although relatively simple in concept, this feature interacted with the entire system, requiring me to be meticulous to avoid any regressions.</strong></p>

        <h3><strong>Final Task: Floating UIs</strong></h3>
        <p><strong>The remainder of my internship involved working on various features, but one last major task arose: creating the Floating UIs.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Previously, menus were displayed on the player's wrist, but this lacked ergonomics. The idea was to integrate floating interfaces inspired by systems used on Meta Quest headsets.</strong></p>
        <div class="side-by-side-images">
            <div class="image-wrapper">
                <img src="Images/wrist_UI.png" alt="wrist ui">
            </div>
            <div class="image-wrapper">
                <img src="Images/spawned_UI.png" alt="spawned UI">
            </div>
        </div>


        <p><strong>After several unsuccessful attempts (UIs too large, cluttered space…), I was tasked with creating a modular and dynamic system: the Floating UIs needed to be summonable from anywhere, attachable to any game element, and easily configurable.</strong></p>
        <img src="Images/floating_UI.png" alt="floating UI">
        <p><strong>This was an opportunity to learn extensively, particularly in C++ and about Unreal Engine 5's internal systems. I documented the entire system in detail: one documentation on its functionality and another on its usage. This made me regret not having done the same for my previous systems, as even well-placed comments cannot replace clear documentation.</strong></p>

        <h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
        <p><strong>My internship at Cyborn solidified my skills in Gameplay Programming and deepened my passion for new technologies and immersive entertainment forms.
Working abroad allowed me to overcome my apprehensions, both linguistically and personally.
I am now convinced of my professional direction and more motivated than ever to contribute to this ever-evolving industry that continues to inspire me.</strong></p>
